      <p>· Percentages and relative values are always converted to pixels</p>
      <p>· Percentages are measured relative to ther parent's <strong>width</strong>, if used to specify lengths</p>
      <p>· <strong>rem</strong> is a RELATIVE unit. It needs to be converted to pixels by the engine. Is always RELATIVE to the root font-size.

      <p>· <strong>em</strong> use the parent (for font) or the current (for length) element as the reference</p>
      <p>· <strong>rem</strong> use the root font-size as the reference</p>
